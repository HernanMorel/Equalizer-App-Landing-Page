- This is a landing page for a fictitious company who is promoting their equalizer phone app
- I used given assets made by frontend-mentor and I also added a few of my own to make this into a much more functional webpage.
- I also re-structured all of the components for the final build.
- I used SCSS/SASS and the Materialize CSS Framework
